# JAddressBook
Simple program of a GUI program with database connection in Java

## Security
This project represents a quick demo on how to build and run an example of a GUI program and connect to a database. The design of the application does not consider crucial security aspects that are required for a real application, especially for what concerns the interaction with the database. For example this client application directly connect to the database instance with root credentials, in a real application there is at least a server application who has a privileged access to the database that executes queries for client.
